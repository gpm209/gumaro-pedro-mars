      <p>
        My name is Gumaro Pedro Matias. I have a bachelor's degree in Molecular
        and Cellular Biology with emphasis on Neurobiology from the University
        of California, Berkeley. One of my favorite hobbies are: learning
        languages and fishing, two things that have very little in common, but
        always make my day. If I'm not working or doing any of the previously
        mentioned activities, I'm probably learning programming with Code the
        Dream.
